------------------------------------------------------

Hot "scheduling"
When a HoT is placed on a player, or a tick happens, the current haste of the casting player determines when the next tick of the HoT will occur. If the players haste changes after a tick happens -- either more haste or less haste --, the next tick still happens at the original "scheduled" time. This means we only care about the haste the same moment a tick happens (or when the HoT is applied). To see proof of this, view the "HoT tick calculations (Draenor)" document, "Haste timing with changes" tab.

------------------------------------------------------

Hot duration/number of ticks
Hot duration does not change with haste, but rather the number of ticks is modified. For example, if the player has 50% haste on a hot with 10 seconds and 5 ticks (2s/tick), the buff duration is still 10 seconds, but there are more ticks. You can calculate the time between ticks with the following calculation:

(NormalTickDuration)/(1 + PlayerHastePercentage) = Tick duration in seconds
Example: 10s duration, 5 ticks, 10% haste. (2s)/(1 + 0.10) = 1.818 seconds until next tick
Example: 10s duration, 5 ticks, 25% haste. (2s)/(1 + 0.25) = 1.600 seconds until next tick
Example: 10s duration, 5 ticks, 50% haste. (2s)/(1 + 0.50) = 1.333 seconds until next tick

When the hot is cast, or a tick happens, the player's current haste determines when the next tick is scheduled. In the above example, if the player had 50% haste when a hot was cast, a tick would happen immediately and the next tick would be scheduled at [CurrentTime + 1.333] seconds. Since the hots are scheduled from the point of view of the current time, we don't care how many ticks occur over the duration of the hot, because the player's haste may change at any time.

------------------------------------------------------

Remainder tick
If the player has any amount of haste, a remainder tick is likely to occur. This remaining tick is a fraction of a normal tick, relative to the time left in the buff. This tick always occurs when the hot buff ends. If the player has no haste (or the haste the player has gives a perfect number of ticks), the remainder tick heals the same as a 'normal' tick. You can calculate the amount of the heal with the following:

(TimeRemaining)/(TickDuration) * TickHealAmount = Final tick healing amount
Example: 1.00s remaining, 2.00s tick duration, 100 heal per tick. (1.00s)/(2.00s) * 100 = 50.0 health healed
Example: 0.75s remaining, 1.81s tick duration, 100 heal per tick. (0.75s)/(1.81s) * 100 = 41.4 health healed
Example: 2.00s remaining, 2.00s tick duration, 100 heal per tick. (2.00s)/(2.00s) * 100 = 100 health healed (no haste example)

------------------------------------------------------

Non-integer heals
When a heal does not come out to an exact integer, it appears the game either rounds or randomizes the final healed amount. More research needs to be done on how the game determines this, however, the healed amount is going to be very small compared to the full healed amount. Currently, in Legion, heals are ticking in excess of 65,000 health per Rejuvenation tick, which amounts to a 0.0015% difference if rounded up or down a single health.
