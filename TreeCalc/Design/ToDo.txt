To Do list for the program

Create classes for buffs/hots
Create a global list of buffs and hots for players. This makes checking buffs (rules like "only have 5 rejuvenations active at one time") MUCH easier to check and there is no reason to split buffs out per person because we can do that with Linq anyway
Be able to create a profile for each WoW patch, containing the spell information from that time. This would allow me to run simulations on future patches or in 'what if' scenarios
