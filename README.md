Runs healing simulations for Restoration Druids in World of Warcraft

This program simulates Restoration Druid healing on a detailed level. Spreadsheets are popular to estimate healing output, but they can't account for complex interactions, such as placement, buffs, mana tracking, etc. I aim to create a program which can simulate a Resto Druid in many situations.
